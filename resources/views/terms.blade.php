    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: October 20, 2025</div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the <strong>Naseh</strong> mobile application ("the App") and explains your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>

    <p><strong>Naseh</strong> is a mobile app that provides personal and financial guidance for users in Egypt. We do not collect any personal data at this time. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our") refers to <strong>Naseh</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> refers to <strong>Naseh</strong>, the mobile software program provided by the Company.</p>
    <p><strong>Country</strong> refers to: Egypt.</p>
    <p><strong>Device</strong> means any device that can access the Service, such as a mobile phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
    <p><strong>Service</strong> refers to the Application.</p>
    <p><strong>You</strong> means the individual using the Service.</p>

    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Data</h2>
    <p>At this time, the Naseh App <strong>does not collect, store, or share any personal data</strong> from users.</p>
    <p>If in the future we introduce features that require data collection (such as creating an account, saving user preferences, or using personalization features), this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly and users will be notified.</p>

    <h2>Firebase Cloud Messaging</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</strong> provided by Google to send important notifications and updates.</p>
    <p>Firebase may collect certain non-identifiable technical data (such as device identifiers or notification tokens) to deliver push notifications. This data is handled according to Google’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
    <p>We do not access or store this data directly.</p>

    <h2>Use of Location or Other Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The current version of the App <strong>does not request access</strong> to location, contacts, camera, or any media on your device. If such features are added in the future, you will be asked for permission before access is granted.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> You can always control app permissions from your device settings. Requests for sensitive permissions will be explicit and optional.
    </div>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to external websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any third-party sites.</p>

    <h2>Future Account Features</h2>
    <p>The App may in the future include authentication or account features. When these are introduced, users will be able to register, manage, and delete their accounts, and this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect the data handling practices associated with those features.</p>

    <h2>Retention of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The Company will retain Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Usage Data (if collected in the future) will be retained for a shorter period unless needed to strengthen security or comply with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ.</p>
    <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

    <h2>Delete Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request deletion of the Personal Data that we have collected about you. If we introduce account features in the future, you will be able to update, amend, or delete your information from within the App, or by contacting us.</p>
    <p>Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We may share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share your personal information with Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service, or to contact you.</li>
        <li><strong>For business transactions:</strong> If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before such transfer.</li>
        <li><strong>With Affiliates:</strong> We may share information with affiliates who will be required to honor this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Law enforcement</h2>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</p>

    <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any significant updates via the App or by email before they take effect.</p>
    <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
